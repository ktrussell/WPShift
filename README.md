# WPShift
This program shifts all waypoints by a single latitude/longitude offset. The offset is defined by the difference in the last waypoint and the next-to-last waypoint in the file. The last waypoint is NOT replicated to the new output file. It is purely placed in the input file to "show" the program how much to offset the other waypoints.
